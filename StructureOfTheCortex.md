# Structure Of The Cortex

A great deal of the functionality of the cortex comes from its anatomy. Neurons, dendrites, axions and synapses are just the components in which the cortical circuits are constructed. As you'll soon see - no particular neuron has any particular function - its the collective neural anatomy that decribes the collective function. Lets start from the highest level of structure and work our way down.

## Cerebrum

The cerebrum is the largest and upper-most part of the brain. It consists of two hemispheres - the left and the right. Each hemisphere has three main structures: the cortex, subcortex, and the white matter inbetween.

### Cortex

The cortex is the outer layer of the cerebrum. It is a thin sheet of grey matter measuring about 5mm thick with an area 1 meter squared. The sheet is structured in six horizontal layers mostly made up of the cell bodies of neurons - giving it a grey-looking color, which is why its called grey matter. HTM theory is oriented around the cortex (specifically the neocortex). We'll go into much more detail later.

### White Matter

Just below the grey matter of the cortex is white matter. It is a vast connection space of myelanated axons origionating from the neurons in the cortex. The axons connect to other parts of the cortex or to other parts of the subcortex. Its called white matter because myelin is made up of fat which is white, unlike the grey of neuron cell bodies. The most important part of the connection infastructure of white matter is the corpus colossum. It is a thick bundle of fibres connecting the two hemispheres together.

### Subcortex

Also known as subcortical structures are the structures that reside beheith the white matter. The most important of them are the thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and the basal ganglia. Although these structures are not important for learning about HTM, it might be useful to note that the hippocampus is a part of the cerebral cortex, so it is also a part of the cortex too.

## Cerebral Cortex

The cortex has evolved as two structures: the allocortex and neocortex. While the neocortex has six layers of grey matter the allocortex has three. The allocortex is much older than the neocortex (neo - meaning "new") and is believed to be the root from which the neocortex evolved. More specifically the hippocampus (a part of the allocortex) is believed to be where the neocortex "grew" from.

Only mammals posses a neocortex. Primative mammals have a relatively small neocortex while more advanced mammals such as humans have a much larger neocortex compared to the allocortex. Of the 100 billion neurons in the human cortex, 10% are in the allocortex while the other 90% are in the neocortex. It is believed humans are more advanced simply because we have the largest neocortex of all the mammals.

Note: because the majority of the cortex is the neocortex, when someone speaks of the cerebral cortex they are generally referring to the neocortex.

## Neocortex

What we consider to be human intelligence comes from the neocortex. For that reason HTM theory is about modelling the operating principles of the neocortex. This starts by understanding its structure.

When learning about the structure of the neocortex one might find the four lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal. These names come from the names of the bones that overlay them.
