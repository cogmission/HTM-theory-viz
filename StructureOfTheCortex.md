# Structure Of The Cortex

A great deal of the functionality of the cortex comes from its anatomy. Neurons, dendrites, axions and synapses are just the components in which the cortical circuits are constructed. As you'll soon see - no particular neuron has any particular function - its the collective neural anatomy that decribes the collective function. Lets start from the highest level of structure and work our way down.

## Cerebrum

The cerebrum is the largest and upper-most part of the brain. It consists of two hemispheres - the left and the right. Each hemisphere has three main structures: the cortex, subcortex, and the white matter inbetween.

### Cortex
The cortex is the outer layer of the cerebrum. It is a thin sheet of grey matter measuring about 5mm thick with an area 1 meter squared. The sheet is structured in six horizontal layers mostly made up of the cell bodies of neurons - giving it a grey-looking color, which is why its called grey matter.

### White Matter

Just below the grey matter of the cortex is white matter. It is a vast connection space of myelanated axons origionating from the neurons in the cortex. The axons connect to other parts of the cortex or to other parts of the subcortex. Its called white matter because myelin is made up of fat which is white, unlike the grey of neuron cell bodies. The most important part of the connection infastructure of white matter is the corpus colossum. It is a thick bundle of fibres connecting the two hemispheres together.

## Subcortex

Also known as subcortical structures are the structures that reside beheith the white matter. The most important of them are the hippocampus, amygdala and the basal ganglia. Although these structures are not important for learning about HTM, it might be useful to note that the hippocampus is a part of the cerebral cortex, so it is also a part of the cortex too.

## Cerebral Cortex

In early evolution its purpose was to compute sensory and motor functions. Later the higher mental functions evolved such as emotion, memory, attention, perception, cognition, consciousness and personality.
